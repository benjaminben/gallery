This will be awesome.

User Stories (pretty straightforward):
- As a user, I can view a gallery home page without authenticating
- From the home page, I can view all posted installations
- I can scrub through the available installations in Tinder-esque fashion
- I can tap an installation to reveal more information about it
- I can launch an installation from the ^ more info menu
- I can experience immersive art with my phone in landscape mode
- I can pause an installation by turning my phone to portrait
- Once paused, I can relocate to the home page from an installation
